# The Iron Book - Workout Diary App

I created this app as part of the **Incentivized Training Program** in collaboration with **VLK Studio**.
The goal was to create a digital workout diary, complete with a timer and a variety of workout options, including weights, cardio, and circuit training.
The project was created with Vite + React/TS, including testing with the React Testing Library (Vitest).

## How it works
From the homepage, you can create new workouts by entering different exercise types with times, recoveries, sets, and reps. Once saved, the workout is displayed in a card at the top of the page and saved to the browser's local storage.
You can also edit previously saved workouts so you don't have to recreate them from scratch.
